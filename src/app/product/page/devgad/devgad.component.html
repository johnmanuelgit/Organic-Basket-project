    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#541a0f] mb-2">About Devgad Alphonso Mango (Devgad Hapus)</h2>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-yellow-700 mb-2">Origin</h3>

    <p class="mb-4">
      A Portuguese explorer, Alfonso de Albuquerque, brought Alphonso mangoes to India.
      From Goa, mangoes traveled to places like Ratnagiri and the southern regions.
      Growers brought grafts from Ratnagiri to Devgad in the early 19th century and planted them in the uprooted trees of other species.
      It resulted in the production of Devgad Alphonso mangoes.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-[#541a0f] mb-6">
      <li>Crowned as the King of Mangoes</li>
      <li>Available from Mid-April to June</li>
      <li>Cultivated in Devgad taluka area</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Our mangoes are born and nurtured in Devgad, a picturesque taluka nestled in the coastal region of Maharashtra, India.
      The region’s unique geographical features and climatic conditions make it the ideal breeding ground for the finest Alphonso mangoes.
      Our farmers, the guardians of this treasured fruit, have honed their craft over the years, passing down knowledge and practices from generation to generation.
      Each tree is a testament to their dedication, bearing fruits that are celebrated not just in Devgad or Ratnagiri but around the world.
